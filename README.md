# Sound Propagation Simulation
This project was created by Middleton Henry as part of an APPL 101 assignment at UNC (Chapel Hill)
The purpose of this project was to create an algorithm for mimicing the biological function of an organism. In this project I created an audio propagation simulation to mimic the bellowing and hissing of a pine snake. This program relies on Unity's Universal Render pipeline to run code on the GPU.

# Key binds:
1 – Switch to wave emission

2 – Switch to collider drawing 

3 – Switch to collider erasing

4 – Save result to .png (file is saved within the application)

Mouse Input – Inputs track mouse and create an effect depending on toggle (keys '1,' '2,' and '3')
